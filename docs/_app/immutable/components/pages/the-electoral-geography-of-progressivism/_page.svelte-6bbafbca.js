With a strong political base in Toronto\u2019s Gay Village, he had risen from working for the pre-amalgamation City of Toronto\u2019s last mayor, Barbara Hall, to provincial MPP, to cabinet minister and deputy premier in Dalton McGuinty\u2019s provincial Liberal government. He campaigned primarily on his political experience, but his platform and campaign lacked definition. Indeed, his and Ford\u2019s articulated policy positions differed more in their tone than their substance: cut waste at City Hall, speed up commute times, make the city safer, and improve the business climate. Rather than inheriting Miller\u2019s coalition and policy legacies, Smitherman, like Ford, ran against them. Indeed, his campaign literature positioned Smitherman as a force for change, one that would \u201CMake you proud to say you\u2019re from Toronto.
