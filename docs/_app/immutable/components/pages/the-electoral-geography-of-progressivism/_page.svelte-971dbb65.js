He did well everywhere in the city, and especially in the same neighbourhoods that favoured his progressive successors. What is notable, however, is where he lost the most support: neighbourhoods in North Toronto, central Etobicoke, and lakefront Scarborough.

He campaigned primarily on his political experience, but his platform and campaign lacked definition. Indeed, his and Ford\u2019s articulated policy positions differed more in their tone than their substance: cut waste at City Hall, speed up commute times, make the city safer, and improve the business climate. Rather than inheriting Miller\u2019s coalition and policy legacies, Smitherman, like Ford, ran against them. Indeed, his campaign literature positioned Smitherman as a force for change, one that would \u201CMake you proud to say you\u2019re from Toronto.
